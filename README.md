# OnlineLearningSystem

1. This is an Online Learning System demo, including register module, login-logout module, homework submitting module, live chat module.

2. The structure of the entire system is based on MVC.

3. The persistence layer is implemented by XML at this time.

4. Some third-party untility tools were imported such as dom4j, beanutils, log4j etc.

5. This demo is mainly focused on the back end, so maybe the front-end side looks not so fancy.

6. Only the register, login-log out module were posted at this time.
